Hello! I'm Bruno Adami, aka, Scytar. I'm a physics, math and english as L2 Teacher that likes to Code and dreams in becoming a real life developer.

I used to work at Rio de Janeiro Justice Court's IT, as a Support Analyst. Currently I'm taking the Alpha EdTech's Dev preparation course in order to making that dream become truth.

Song composing and experimental music are some of my hobbies as well!
