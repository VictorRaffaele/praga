Hi! My name is Luana Lessa, but you can call me Lessa. I'm from Ceara ðŸŒµ, Brazil, and I'm  passionate about programming. 
I'm currently working as an aspiring full stack developer at Alpha EdTech. 
I also like to spend time learning new stuff and debating about social issues on Coletivo Donzelinha
